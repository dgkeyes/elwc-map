```{r child = "setup.Rmd"}
```

There will be some introduction text here. 

I'll add text that explains the maps here. Things like:

- Dots are schools
- Hover over any area to get more info
- Issues with data


```{r, layout="l-page"}
composite_score %>% 
  make_map()

composite_score %>% 
  make_table()
```
